# Plotly-challenge

**Objectives**
The objective of this challenge was to build an interactive dashboard describing the bacteria from human navels. 

**Tools**
I used the Javascript libraries d3 and Plotly for this challenge. 

**Data**
The data used in this challenge was gathered from:
Hulcr, J. et al.(2012) _A Jungle in There: Bacteria in Belly Buttons are Highly Diverse, but Predictable_. Retrieved from: [http://robdunnlab.com/projects/belly-button-biodiversity/results-and-data/](http://robdunnlab.com/projects/belly-button-biodiversity/results-and-data/)

**Dashboard**
The dashboard allows the user to select numbered test subjects using a dropdown menu, which will automatically update 4 other charts:
- Demographic Info: displays basic info about the test subject e.g. ID number, ethnicity, age, gender etc. 
- Top 10 Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs): This is the top groupings of bacteria for each subject
- Belly Button Washing Frequency: # of times the subject washed their belly button per week
- Bubble chart of OTU IDs vs Sample sizes

The final dashboard can be viewed here:
